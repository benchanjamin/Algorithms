/**
 *  The {@code MaxPQ} class represents a priority queue of generic keys.
 *  It supports the usual <em>insert</em> and <em>delete-the-maximum</em>
 *  operations, along with methods for peeking at the maximum key,
 *  testing if the priority queue is empty, and iterating through
 *  the keys.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses a <em>binary heap</em>.
 *  The <em>insert</em> and <em>delete-the-maximum</em> operations take
 *  &Theta;(log <em>n</em>) amortized time, where <em>n</em> is the number
 *  of elements in the priority queue. This is an amortized bound
 *  (and not a worst-case bound) because of array resizing operations.
 *  The <em>min</em>, <em>size</em>, and <em>is-empty</em> operations take
 *  &Theta;(1) time in the worst case.
 *  Construction takes time proportional to the specified capacity or the
 *  number of items used to initialize the data structure.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation, see
 *  <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq">Section 2.4</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
