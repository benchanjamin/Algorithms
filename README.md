# Algorithms

I created a C++ library that replicates most of the functionalities of Prof. Sedgewick and Prof. Wayne's Java libraries
from their textbook, Algorithms, 4th edition. All of C++ programs are tested in my main.cpp file.

Here are where my files were originated from:

[Bag.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/13stacks/Bag.java.html) -> Bag.hpp
[BinarySearch.java](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/11model/BinarySearch.java.html) -> BinarySearch.hpp
